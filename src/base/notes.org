* Design and implementation of underlying data structures

The C++ code in this directory implements the built-in data structures of fn. For the purposes of
development, the native structures will be phased into the project a little bit at a time.

At the time of writing, all the objects in fn are represented by Common Lisp data structures. The
next steps will involve implementing equivalent C++ data structures and slowly phasing these in
using SBCL's ffi.

This is the order in which I plan to implement native data structures
- null
- true and false
- floats
- strings
- functions
- lists

Functions is going to be a really tough one, because that's going to be where
