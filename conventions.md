## Comment Conventions

Different numbers of parentheses as well as ALLCAPS strings are used to
differentiate different comments, so that files are easier to search.

``` lisp
;;;; File or section description

;;;;;;
;;; Section header
;;;;;;

;;; Top level comment (describes a definition)

;; Code-level comment (describes behavior of following code)

; Line-end comment (describes a single line)

;; FIXME: small bug
;; BIGFIXME: more important bug
;; TODO: unimplemented behavior
```
