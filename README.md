## A Note to the Reader: Proceed with Caution

This is a personal project to make a programming language. All the source
contained herein comes with no guarantee of quality (although I try my best!),
no support (but leave a comment if you have one!), and a very, very unstable
interface.

No effort has been made to make this code readable to other people, in case the
fact that I'm using Common Lisp wasn't a giveaway. No effort has been or will be
made to implement features or libraries that I, the despot, do not personally
desire. That said, feel free to use the code as you want, as long as you abide
the GPLv3 license.
