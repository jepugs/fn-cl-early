(defun $-reader (stream char)
  "Read in an anonymous function. $(expr) expands to a LAMBDA form. The
arguments to the function are accessed using $-args (which are precisely
described below). The generated functions take exactly as many arguments as the
highest numbered arguments, but can accept variadic arguments if the symbol $&
occurs in expr.

EXAMPLES:
> ;; add 17 to a list
> (mapcar $(+ $ 17) '(1 2 3 4))
 (18 19 20 21)
> ;; sum even numbers at each index
> (mapcar $(apply #'+ (remove-if #'oddp $&)) '(-1 5 2) '(2 4 0) '(-2 -3 -1))
 (0 4 2)
> ;; convert a list of bits to a number
> (reduce $(+ (* $0 2) $1) '(1 0 1 1))

TYPES OF $-ARGS:
 $  is the first argument (equivalent to $0).
 $N where N is a natural number with no leading 0s, accesses the Nth
    argument (indexed by 0). E.g. $1 gets the second argument, $2 the third,
    and so on.
 $& gets all arguments after the highest numeric $-arg

$ DISPATCH CHARACTERS:
  The $ reader macro is nonterminating and is only triggered when it is followed
by one of these characters: (, [, {, or `. Otherwise, the $-reader is
temporarily disabled and the stream is read normally.

NESTING $ EXPRESSIONS:
  $ expressions can be trivially nested. $-args in the higher levels are
completely shadowed in the lower levels. This is a decision made to keep syntax
simple and to discourage abuse of $().

QUIRKS:
  $-args are detected based on symbol name and are indifferent to package. The
surrounding lambda binds these names directly as function arguments. In
detecting $-args, the expression is macroexpanded first, and non-lists, quoted
forms, and nested $() forms are discarded, but no non-trivial code walking is
done other than that. Thus, you should avoid using variables with $-arg names in
the function body, as it could mess up the argument list.
  The ->$ macro can safely be used within $() because the $ symbol is eliminated
from the body during macroexpansion. More exotic macros may have their behavior
broken by the messed up macroexpansion order.
