Today's goal:

Create prototype ADT system without support for protocols. All we need are
the three special types, _, or, & ->, and pattern-based matching.

The end goal is to have this function:

(defun funcall-type (ftype arg-types)
  ...)

Which will work like a pipeline:

(is-subtype sub super) ->> (type-bindings super sub) ->> check other stuff

We won't yet implement quoted types.
